# Basic Introduction #

Bash simple curses is a very simple system to create "bash windows" and append texts into. You only have to know some functions and what to show.

Let's take a look on this little tutorial

# Importing bash functions #

Create a directory where we will work. For example
```
mkdir -p ~/tutorial/bashcurses
```

Get bashsimplecurses sources on SVN.
```
cd ~/tutorial/bashcurses
svn checkout http://bashsimplecurses.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ bashsimplecurses
```

Now, create a tutorial.sh script and edit it, you can use vim, gedit, nano...:
```
touch tutorial.sh
#vim tutorial.sh
#or nano tutorial.sh
```

It's ok, then you can add this into your code:
```
#!/bin/bash

#import bashsimplecurses
source $(dirname $0)/bashsimplecurses/simple_curses.sh

#create the main function
main(){
   window "Title of my window"
   append "It's the content of my window"
   endwin
}
#then ask the standard loop
main_loop
```

It's ok ? save your work. Now, you only have to set this script "executable"
```
chmod +x ~/tutorial/bashcurses/tutorial.sh
```

Now, you can try:
```
~/tutorial/bashcurses/tutorial.sh
```

And a window appear ! To close your script, you only have to kill or press CTRL+C

## Title Colors ##

You can specify colors for titles, change line on tutorial like this:
```
...
   window "Title of my window" "red"
```

Restart your script, and the title is red.

For now, only 4 colors are implented:
  * red
  * green
  * blue
  * grey

Next versions will implement severals other colors.


## Sizes ##

By default, windows take 100% of terminal width. You can specify number of cols to use:
```
...
   window "Title of my window" "red" 36
```

This will set the width to 36 caracters (cols).

## the functions please ! ##

Ok !

  * **window "TITLE" "COLOR" WIDTH** = create a window with title, color and width
  * **append "TEXT"** = append text to the window, be carefull "\n" are not interpreted, you have to append line by line
  * **append\_tabbed "TEXTE" COLS SEP** = As "append" function but TEXT will be displayed as table. You need to give number of cols you will display. SEP is ":" by default
  * **append\_file** display a file text on window, text is wrapped to fit window
  * **append\_command** Execute command and display result on window
  * **addsep** = Append a separator
  * **main\_loop SEC** = run loop every SEC second, default is 1 second

That's all folks !
